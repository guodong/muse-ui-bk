Creating an asset requires the following:
* A valid asset symbol
* A larger than 0 maximum supply

The precision will determine the number of decimal points that the asset will support.

The asset creation fee depends primarily on the length of the asset symbol.

You may also specify a market fee that determines the percentage of fees to keep.
